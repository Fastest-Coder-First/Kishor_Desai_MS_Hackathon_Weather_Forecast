# Weather Forecasting Tool

This command-line tool accepts a city's name as input and returns the current weather forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API. It leverages Python to fetch weather data and parse it, demonstrating how GitHub Copilot can assist with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tool, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Requests library (can be installed using `pip install requests`)

## Usage

To use the Weather Forecasting Tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-forecast-tool.git

   ```

3. Run the tool with the desired city name as an argument:
